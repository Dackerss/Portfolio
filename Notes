Week 3
<h3> Bad Planning <h3>
<p> All members of the team built their pages with a skeleton html file with the intention of dropping in css at a later date.
When it came time to set up the css, our fotmatting wasnt correct and as a result created more work for the group.
If we had taken extra time at the start of the project this extra work could have been avoided.
Although a small issue it alerted the team to the importance of taking time to plan before racing off to complete our assign tasks. </p>
